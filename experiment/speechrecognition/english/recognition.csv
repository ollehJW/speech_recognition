6345-93302-0015.flac,a shock of unbelievable relief single through her so that was all but was it compared with her fears
6345-93302-0014.flac,and yesterday I had a letter from her and she seems to expect to think and I thought I had to tell you darling
6345-93302-0010.flac,the Kean wind thrust itself even inside the high collar of her jacket
6345-93302-0020.flac,couldn't help it that how can I ever trust you
6345-93302-0009.flac,but here the only thing that occurred to her was to stop and look in one of the shops till he should ask her what she was looking at
6345-93302-0027.flac,at the corner he remembered that he had gone away without paying for the tea and his natural impulse was to go back and remedy that error
6345-93302-0001.flac,her hands should have been full of bluebells and she should have held them up to his face and made him lie defense as he sprang forward to take her in his arms
6345-93302-0029.flac,so he enlisted and went to South Africa and he never came home covered with medals and Glory which was rather his idea to the few simple words of explanation that would have made all straight and repaid her and him for all the past
6345-93302-0008.flac,it happened late he had offered no excuse no explanation
6345-93302-0007.flac,it was bitterly cold but the embankment was more romantic than a railway carriage
6345-93302-0013.flac,she said how frightfully cold it is
6345-93302-0006.flac,the setting of the scene seemed to her all-important
6345-93302-0022.flac,no it's only painful for both of us
6345-93302-0003.flac,she had to the full then it allowed of her reading and her environment the literary sense
6345-93302-0019.flac,those for true words wounded her more than all the rest
6345-93302-0000.flac,she herself should have been a poem a lyric in a white gown and green scarf coming to him through the long grass under the blossoms boughs
6345-93302-0023.flac,I didn't think a decent man could do such things she was pulling on her gloves go home and gloat over at all
6345-93302-0018.flac,I don't wonder you were afraid to tell me she began you don't love me you've never loved me I was an idiot to believe you did
6345-93302-0004.flac,and curiously enough she was hardly curious at all about what he might have to say
6345-93302-0025.flac,are you really going to throw me over for a thing like this
6345-93302-0011.flac,her hands and feet were aching with cold
6345-93302-0024.flac,he stood up Suddenly do you mean it
6345-93302-0002.flac,you see that she knew exactly how a tryst is conducted in the pages of the standard poets and of the cheaper weekly journals
6345-93302-0005.flac,she only wished for May and the orchard instead of January and the dingy Dusty waiting room the plane faced preoccupied Travelers the dim desolate weather
6345-93302-0012.flac,she would have shared his sorrow and shown herself half wife half angel from heaven in this dark hour
6345-93302-0026.flac,and he Strode down between the marble tables and out by the swing door it was a very good exit
6345-93302-0021.flac,do you think I'm not sorry now
6345-93302-0017.flac,following the tingle of relief came as sharp sickening pinch of jealousy and mortification these inspired her
6345-93302-0028.flac,he checked the cilium pulse
6345-93302-0016.flac,what opinion would he form of the purity of her mind the innocence of her soul if an incident like this failed to shock her deeply
